My computer science experience goes back to high school. Before I decided to major in computer science I took AP computer science principles. 
After taking that class I decided to learn a bit of java over the summer with my previous teacher's help. My first year at New Paltz I took CS1 and 2. 
These classes were fun and not stressful as a first year student. My second year I took OOP, CS3, OS, Computer architecture and assembly language and lastly discrete mathematics. 
These classes were all pretty miserable online if i'm being honest and my love for coding went downhill from being at my computer 10+ hours a day. 
Since then I have not been involved in many projects but this semester I am taking my coding to a new level by not only taking this class but also Software engineering.
My entire semester is heavy coding and algorithms and I could not be more excited. This is my future and I am beyond excited to start getting a lot of experience in full stack development. 


I see myself using what we learn in this class to decide on my specializations with my computer science degree. I'm hoping I can use what I learn in this class and really develop my fitness app into something I am proud of. 
My plan is to not just let this course be the last of the app. I want to work and improve my app until I could possibly put it on the app store or even make it into a software online to be purchased and start my own coaching for fitness. 
Also, this semester will tell me if I want to be a software engineer or go into a different specialization with computer science. 

The only support I need from you is patience when asked silly or irrational questions. Coming from online school, I can already tell mentally I am not used to the toll that being on campus can do to your body.
As long as I know I have my professors' support and that my professor has patience for this wils adjustment I know I can handle what this year has to throw at me.
